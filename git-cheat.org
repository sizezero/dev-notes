# updating a local repository with remote changes

# When you use pull, Git tries to automatically do your work for you. It
# is context sensitive, so Git will merge any pulled commits into the
# branch you are currently working in. pull automatically merges the
# commits without letting you review them first. If you don't closely
# manage your branches you may run into frequent conflicts.

# When you fetch, Git gathers any commits from the target branch that do
# not exist in your current branch and stores them in your local
# repository. However, it does not merge them with your current
# branch. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your
# repository up to date, but are working on something that might break
# if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your master
# branch, you use merge.
